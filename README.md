# Task 1
1. Queue
2. Not in this code
3. You can use the dot notation qsize(). If my queue was named queue then to find out the length of it I would use queue.qsize()
4. To add an item to the collection you use the dot notation put(). If my queue was named queue then I would use queue.put("Hello world") to input the string hellow world into the queue. If you try to add an item to the queue when it is full then you get an error and the program will not run.
5. To remove an item you use the dot nation get(). If my queue was named queue then to remove the first item from the list then I would use queue.get(). If I were to try and remove an item that was not in the queue then I would get an error and the program would not run.
6. To do this when creating the queue you can use .LifoQueue() to make it a last in first out queue.
